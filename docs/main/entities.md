## Main Entities

The purpose is not to describe the full data model of Audiveris, but simply to introduce some
key notions that are used throughout the whole application and that the user needs to understand
correctly.

We will thus speak of:
* Physical containment: [Book of Sheets](book_sheet.md)
* Logical containment: [Score of Pages](score_page.md)
* Interpretations: [Glyph and related Inters](glyph_inter.md)
* Relations between Inters: the [Symbol Interpretation Graph](sig.md)
