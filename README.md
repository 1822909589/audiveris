# audiveris-ng

This repository contains source code for the new generation of Audiveris optical
music recognition software.

## CAUTION!

**The Audiveris project is currently transitioning its code base from Kenai.com to
Github. This will take approx. two weeks. We won't be able to accept pull
requests until this transition is finished (this message will disappear then).
Thank you for your patience!**
